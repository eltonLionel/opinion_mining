I left a review on the product stating that my order was cancelled because of the recent price in BTC. the machines were making money now rather than losing. Amazon refuses to allow me to leave a review. <br/><br/> <br/>Thank you for submitting a customer review.<br/><br/>Thank you for submitting a customer review on Amazon. After carefully reviewing your submission, your review could not be posted to the website. While we appreciate your time and comments, reviews must adhere to the following guidelines:<br/>Amazon Community Guidelines<br/><br/>The review was honest, not offensive and informed people not to waste nearly 1 month ordering from a company that has no intention of shipping the product.<br/><br/>Its my belief that said company takes your money, buys the miners and sell domestically at a profit then issue a refund on amazon.<br/><br/>The easiest way to make money on amazon is not by selling... this is well known.<br/><br/>Amazon should be ashamed for not allowing my review up.<br/><br/>My review mentioned nothing of what i said about the company using my money to fund there own business practises.<br/><br/>It was honest based on my experience with the purchase.<br/><br/>Censorship!!<br/><br/>Taking My Money Elsewhere... And for the Staff that read this and check into it. You will see just how much i spend.\n",
